<p><font size="5"> LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING RFID AND CLOUD </font></p>
<p><font size="4">In Library Check-in/check-out system of our organization we are using the register book to fill the detail of check-in/check-out,
 its take lot of time to register in that book and require more books. Here, we cannot easily track the students/faculty visiting the library.
 In the present system all work is done on paper. In our library system we have to check-in/check-out in to a library manually.
 Here we have to write the detail of check in timings and name it will take lot of time to register. Information is manually entered.
 In our proposed system, Visualizing every library check-in/check-out event of every student and lecture entering a library getting recorded and stored in the database No manual library check-in/check-out management (roll calling), thus saving time for more teaching–learning activities. It happens with RFID library tracking system. Each student would be provided an RFID chip/tag near the RFID reader makes the library checkin/check-out complete. Stay with the trend and ensure ‘positive performance’ of school, college and students, installing RFID student library management system from SMART. Schools gain a competitive advantage of monitoring student movement in the school campus and tracking their presence in the school premises. RFID is becoming a part of our lives, a little bit of this identification device can change the way library is managed.
